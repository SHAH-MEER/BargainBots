## üìñ Project Overview
**BargainBots** is an advanced AI-powered system designed to discover, analyze, and recommend the best online deals in real time. The platform leverages a pipeline of collaborative agents, combining the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs), traditional machine learning models, embeddings, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for robust, accurate, and scalable deal processing.

The system is modular, extensible, and production-grade, with support for cloud-native deployment (Modal), CI/CD, and automated documentation. BargainBots is suitable for e-commerce, price comparison, and deal aggregation platforms.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Multi-Agent Pipeline:** Specialized agents for deal scanning, price prediction (XGBoost, fine-tuned LLMs), filtering, and orchestration.
- **Real-Time Deal Fetching:** Continuously monitors online sources for new deals.
- **Hybrid AI:** Combines LLMs, classic ML, and RAG for best-in-class accuracy.
- **Memory & Deduplication:** Avoids duplicate recommendations using memory modules.
- **Remote Execution:** Supports Modal for scalable, serverless execution.
- **Live Activity Logs:** Monitor agent activity and pipeline progress in real time.
- **Modern DevOps:** Dockerized, CI/CD with GitHub Actions, pre-commit hooks, and code quality enforcement.
- **Testing & Security:** Built-in unit testing and security checks.
- **Auto-Docs:** Generates changelogs and documentation with LLMs and MkDocs.
- **User Interface:** Clean UI for monitoring, configuration, and manual deal review.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview
```
[Deal Sources] ‚Üí [Deal Scanner Agent] ‚Üí [Central Orchestrator] ‚Üí [Price Agents (LLM/ML/RAG)] ‚Üí [Filter/Memory] ‚Üí [UI/API]
```
- **Deal Scanner Agent:** Scrapes and ingests deals from various sources.
- **Central Orchestrator:** Coordinates specialized agents and manages the pipeline.
- **Price Agents:** Use XGBoost, fine-tuned LLMs, and RAG for price prediction.
- **Filter/Memory:** Filters out duplicates and manages deal memory.
- **UI/API:** Presents results and allows user interaction.
